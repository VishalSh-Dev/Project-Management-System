Project Management System (PMS) designed to streamline project workflows
and enhance collaboration among team members. Leveraging the power of
Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), this
project aims to address the challenges faced by project teams during the
development lifecycle.

The proposed system facilitates comprehensive project planning, task assignment,
progress tracking. Servlets act as the backbone of the system, handling user
requests, managing sessions, and ensuring secure data transfer. JSP, with its
dynamic content generation capabilities, is employed for creating the user
interface, providing an intuitive and responsive experience for project stakeholders.
To ensure data integrity and persistence, the project utilizes JDBC to establish a
connection with a relational database. This enables efficient storage and retrieval
of project-related information, such as task details, timelines, and resource
allocation. The system's architecture is designed to scale, accommodating the
evolving needs of projects of varying sizes and complexities.
